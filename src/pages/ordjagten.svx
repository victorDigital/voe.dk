## Reinventing Word Games Through AI

In a digital landscape filled with conventional word games, Ordjagten (Danish for "The Word Hunt") stands apart by leveraging advanced computational linguistics to create a uniquely challenging and intellectually stimulating experience. Unlike traditional word games that rely on dictionary definitions or simple letter arrangements, Ordjagten employs AI-powered word embeddings to measure the semantic distance between words, creating a game of conceptual proximity rather than just vocabulary.

### The Challenge

Word games typically suffer from several limitations:

1. **Predictability**: Most follow established patterns that become repetitive
2. **Limited Learning Value**: They rarely introduce players to new vocabulary relationships
3. **Shallow Engagement**: Many games rely on chance rather than cognitive reasoning
4. **Lack of Social Competition**: Few games effectively integrate friendly competition into the experience

### The Ordjagten Solution

Ordjagten addresses these challenges by creating a daily word guessing game that uses advanced linguistic models to transform how players think about language and word relationships.

## Key Features

### Innovative Gameplay Mechanics

The core gameplay revolves around an elegant yet challenging concept:

- Each day presents a new target word to discover
- Players submit guesses and receive feedback on how semantically close they are to the target word
- The proximity is calculated using FastText word embeddings that represent words as vectors in multi-dimensional space
- The game rewards both vocabulary depth and understanding of conceptual relationships between words

### Social Competition Elements

Ordjagten enhances the gaming experience through social features:

- Add friends to your network
- View daily scores and historical performance of friends
- Compare your solving approach with others
- Optional anonymous play for those who prefer privacy

### Secure Authentication

The game provides flexible authentication options:

- Secure Google authentication for a seamless login experience
- Anonymous play for those who prefer not to create an account
- Persistent game state across devices when logged in

### Responsive Design

Ordjagten is built with modern web technologies to ensure:

- Fully responsive design that adapts to any screen size
- Optimized experience for both mobile and desktop platforms
- Intuitive touch controls for mobile users
- Clean, distraction-free interface that focuses on gameplay

## Technical Implementation

### FastText Word Embeddings

At the core of Ordjagten's unique gameplay experience lies its use of FastText word embeddings:

- Created by Facebook's AI Research lab, FastText represents words as vectors in a 300-dimensional space
- Words with similar meanings appear closer together in this vector space
- This allows the game to calculate meaningful semantic distances between words
- The implementation handles both common and rare words effectively

### Modern Web Stack

The game is built using a robust and modern technology stack:

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit for a highly responsive and interactive UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components for a clean, modern design
- **Backend**: Server-side rendering and API endpoints through SvelteKit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed through Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- **Authentication**: OAuth integration for Google authentication

### Self-Hosted Infrastructure

The entire application is self-hosted for maximum control and performance:

- Deployed using Docker containers for consistent environments
- Managed through Coolify for streamlined deployment and updates
- Database hosted on the same server for reduced latency
- Regular backups to ensure data safety
